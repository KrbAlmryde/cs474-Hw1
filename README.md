# README #

This README documents the installation and usage for the cs474 HW1 tasked with computing the
[Halstead Complexity Measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halstead_complexity_measures)  

### What is this repository for? ###

* Using the [Scala language](http://www.scala-lang.org/) this application parses a **Java** project, using the 
[Eclipse AST Parser](https://www.eclipse.org/articles/article.php?file=Article-JavaCodeManipulation_AST/index.html) 
to generate its Abstract Syntax tree in order to identify operators and operands which may be used to compute the 
**Halstead Complexity Measure** 
* 1.1.0

### How do I get set up? ###

* From the commandline (assuming you are in top level project directory) type the following:

        gradle --daemon run
